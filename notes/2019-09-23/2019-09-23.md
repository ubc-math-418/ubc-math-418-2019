$\Phi(P) = P-1$ for $P$ prime.
$\Phi(P^n) = P^n-p^{n-1}$ for $P$ prime.

**Euler's Theorem**:

Let $m\in\mathbb N$ and $a\in\mathbb Z$ s.t. $\gcd(a, m) = 1$. Then $a^{\Phi(m)} \equiv 1 \pmod m$

[Scr.: Here, Ghioca explored the case of $a=4$ and $m=15$ as an elucidating example]

**Proof**:

let $S = (\mathbb Z / m\mathbb Z)^*$. Let $f:S\rightarrow S$ given by $f(\bar i) = \bar a \bar i$.

*Claim*: $f$ is well-defined.

Indeed, since $\gcd(i, n) = 1$ we have $\gcd(ai, n) = 1$ (because $\gcd(a, n) = 1$).

**Claim**: $f$ is a bijection. Since $S$ is closed under $f$, it sufficies to prove either $f$ is injective or surjective.

Injectivity: since $a$ is invertible, we have $ai \equiv aj \pmod m \Rightarrow i \equiv j \pmod m$.

[Scr.: Ghioca proved both in class, but injectivity is the simplest.]
